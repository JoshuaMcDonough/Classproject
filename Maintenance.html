<H2> Annual Maintenance</H2>

<h3> Oil </H3>
<P> If you own any vehicle then you know that you are going to have to service your vehicle and one of the easiest things to do is change your oil. Since most people aren't or do not want to ride all year long due to weather doesnt mean that you dont have to change your oil less frequently. Even if your not riding oil will still degrade over time so its recommended that you change it at least once a year. Also, when you check the oil you will want to make sure that its not dark or dirty because bad oil can cause damage to your bike. If you do have to change your oil because its been to long or is dirty dont forget to take a look at the oil filter and possibly change it out as well.

<H3> Air Filter</H3>
<P> This is definitely one of the easiest things to change on most bikes because the housing for your air filter is directly on the outside, usually unobstructed by anything. Even though it is easy to get to and change doesnt mean that it isnt essential to look at. The wrong fuel air mixture or lack of air can cause damage to the engine or even can cause the engine to rev uncontrollably which could cause you to lose control.

<H3> Tires</H3>
<p> There are plenty of tire to choose from depending on which style of bike you have. No matter what type, brand, or style you still need to make sure they are servicable. On thing you will need to make sure is there is no damage to the sidewall and they are not falling apart. The last thing is to make sure they have the correct air pressure in them. If you have to little you can damage the wheel and to much you will wear the tire out unevenly. It will definately be noticeable when you are riding and going around corners if you need to stop and add or remove air from your tires.

<h3>Battery</h3>
<p> We all know that batteries have a specific lifetime and just like your car you have to replace them every few years. Motorcycle batteries are alot smaller but do require a little more maintenance because during the winter months most people wont be riding. Even if no one is riding doesnt mean that the battery is loosing its charge, so you will need to hook up a battery tender. This will charger the battery throught the winter so that when you want to start it up the spring, it will actually start
