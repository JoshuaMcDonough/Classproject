</header>


<Main>

<h3> Briefings </H3>
<P> On the home page we have already gone over the basic requirements before you can ride your motorcycle however, there are still a few briefings that you need to attend to keep your certification up to date in the military. The first one is kind of obvious if you have ever been in the military...you will need a safety briefing and both the wing safety office and the commander will give you a silmular briefing. The second one is again center around safety but is required annually. This is your seasonal motorcycle briefing and it helps newer riders get more in depth information about the local area as well as learn from other riders on the installation.</P>

<H3> TCLOCS</H3>
<P> This accroym is very important for not just new riders but expereinced ones as well. It stands for Tires, Controls, Lights, Oil, Chassis, and Stands. This is everything you should look over before you ride your bike and not just after taking it out of storage. Luckily, there isn't alot of that makes up a bike and all of it is within eyesight. Its better to take the extra few seconds and glance over all these items than find out while riding that somethings wrong.</p>
