<p> This website was designed to help anyone that wants to learn how to ride a motorcyle. A lot of people see motorcycles and immediately have a lot of questions. How do i ride one> what do i need to do to get my license? is it safe?. Those are just a few of the questions I get asked by people who are interested in picking up this hobby.</p>

<p> So i decided to make a website that shows not only what you will need in order to get your license but also answer all those those daunting questions about what it takes to ride a motorcyle in 5 easy steps</p>

<br>

<h2>Step 1: choosing the right gear</h2>


<p>

 The first thing you need to do in order to ride a motorcyle is actually purchase at a minimum gloves, helmet, and jacket. We will go into more details about the types of equipment later on, this is just to give you an overview of what is needed. I would also like to point out at this time that that majority of motorcycle crashes aren't caused by the motorcyclist but by other drivers. This is why choosing something that makes you easy to spot is very important.

<h2> Step 2: Basic Riding Course</h2>
<p> The first step in riding a motorcycle is actually attending a motorcycle course. This is something that is required in order to get your license and gives you a little practice in order to fully be comfortable doing. Taking adavantage of this course is also a great way to find out what bike fits your style as well as learning how those different motorcylces respond when riding. There are many different Motorcycle saftey courses that will teach youhow to ride and it will be on beginner bikes which are a lot easier to control than larger cruisers or faster sports bikes.

<h2>Step 3: get your license</h2> 
 
 <p> This is the easiest step...take your Basic Rider Course certificate and current drivers license to your local DMV and you get your license.

 <h2>Step 4: Choosing the right motorcycle </h2> 
  
  <p> Now that you have your license you can start looking into what type of motorcycle you want to ride. There are a lot of different brand and styles of bikes to choose from and we will go over a few different sub categories on the "Types of Motorcycles" page. However, there are two main groups when people think of bikes, Cruisers and sportsbikes

  <h2>Step 5: Advanced rider course</h2> 
  
    <p> This is final step before you can ride your motorcycle on base but if you dont want to ride on base then you obviously wont need to do this step. Also, depending on what type of motorcylce you decide to ride will determine how often you have to take this class. With that being said this is one of the more enjoyable classes because you get to go through tighher turns on courses and practice emergency stops which gets you more familiar with you bike.
