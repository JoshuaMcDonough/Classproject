<a href="https://joshuamcdonough.github.io/Classproject/aboutme.html">About me</a>

<p> This website was designed to help anyone that wants to learn how to ride a motorcyle. A lot of people see motorcycles and immediately have a lot of questions. How do i ride one> what do i need to do to get my license? is it safe?. Those are just a few of the questions I get asked by people who are interested in picking up this hobby.</p>

<p> So i decided to make a website that shows not only everything that you will need in order to get your license but also answer all those those daunting questions about what it takes to ride a motorcyle</p>
