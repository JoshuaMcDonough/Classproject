<h2> A litte about myself</H2>
  
<P> I am currently a tactical aircraft maintenance craftsman in the united states Air Force. It sounds fancy but, most people common refer to people in my carreer field as crew chiefs and all we are is simply aircraft mechanics. I have been in for 12 years and I'm currently stationed at Langley AFB. Although it is no longer my primary job to be on the flighline fixing aircraft in person with my current position, I'm still able to go out of the office and help the younger airmen. With that being said it was only after being put into an office that I bgan to learn about programming and how much i enjoy it. Outside of work i enjoy spending time with family. I have been married for 10 years and have 3 kids ranging in ages from 6 to 18.</P>

 <H2> Hobbies </h2>
 
<p> Unfortunately, most of my time is spent at work and like I said it mostly behind a desk. So we I can a chance I enjoy to work on my car and help friends and family fix their vehicles. My favorite vehicle is my motorcycle because I like how interactive you have to be ride using your whole body and how simplistic the design is as well as the maintenance. My favorite hobby though is just spending time with the family and whenever i get the chance. My daughters love to be outside doing everything from hiking, beaches and even the playground. so when it comes to checking websites frequently espicially in Virginia this time of the year its the weather.</p>
