<p> This website was designed to help anyone that wants to learn how to ride a motorcyle. A lot of people see motorcycles and immediately have a lot of questions. How do i ride one> what do i need to do to get my license? is it safe?. Those are just a few of the questions I get asked by people who are interested in picking up this hobby.</p>

<p> So i decided to make a website that shows not only what you will need in order to get your license but also answer all those those daunting questions about what it takes to ride a motorcyle</p>

<br>

<h2> Step 1: Basic Riding Course</h2>
<p> The first step in riding a motorcycle is actually attending a motorcycle course. This is something that you requires a little practice in order to fully be comfortable doing and taking adavantage of these course is not only required to get a license but also a great way to find out what bike fits your style. There are many different Motorcycle saftey courses that will teach you on beginner bikes which are a lot easier to control than larger cruisers or fast sports bikes.</p>

<h2>Step 2: get your license 
 
 <p> This is the easiest step...take your Basic Rider Course certificate and current drivers license to your local DMV and you get your license.

 <h2>Step 3: Choosing the right motorcycle and gear for you
  
  <p> Now that you have your license you can start looking into what type of motorcycle you want to ride. There are a lot of different brand and styles of bikes to choose from and we will go over a few different sub categories on the "Types of Motorcycles" page. However, there are two main groups when people think of bikes, Cruisers and sportsbikes. in addtion to the type of bikes you will need to make sure you have the right Personal Protective Gear (PPE) when rideing a bike. Most BIC courses will provide the required equipment if you havent already purchased a helmet and gloves prior to attending. There are also specific guidances that you have to follow when going onto certain military installations, so to make sure you have the right gear please look over the different types on the "Motorcyle Gear" page
