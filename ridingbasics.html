<p> The first thing you need to know when riding a motorcycle is where each control is and what each control does. This is important because you will be using both arms and feet throughout the ride. Below is a basic layout of the controls and a more in depth description and understanding of each component.</p>

  <h2>Controls</h2>
  <p>As you can see with the image, there are alot of controls and knowing where they are so you don't have to keep looking down is important. So, we will forcus on the right side first. On the rght side you will have both brake, your right are will control the front brake located on the handlebars and your right foot will control the rear brake which is just forward of your foot peg. The left side of your body will control the clutch and shifting required to change gears. the clutch is located on the left side of the handlebars and the shifter is located in front of the left foot.

    <p>In addtion to knowing where those key controls are you will need to know how to start the motorcyle. This is a little different then with a car because there are a few things that will prevent ignition. the first step is obviously to put the key in and turn it to the on position. next you going to want to make sure engine cut off switch in is in the "on" position and that the bike is in the nuetral position. Once you have done all that you are ready to start your motorcycle. Make sure you are holding the brakes and press the electric start to start the motorcycle.</p>

    <p> The next part gets a little more confusing is more of a deterence to some potential riders...Shifting. The reason it deters petople is because to engage the first gear you need to press down then all other gears you need to pull up on the shift lever. you will commonly hear people say 1 down 4 up or 1 down 5 up depending on how many gears you have. That isn't to bad but then you have neautral, this gear is located between 1st and 2nd. if you press all the way down it goes into 1st so its only halfway down to engage. You can also get to neutral from 1st and is again halfway between 2nd and 1st.below is an illustration of shifting</p>
