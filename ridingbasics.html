<p> The first thing you need to know when riding a motorcycle is where each control is and what each control does. This is important because you will be using both arms and feet throughout the ride. Below is a basic layout of the controls and a more in depth description and understanding of each component.</p>

  <h2>Controls</h2>
  <p>As you can see with the image, there are alot of controls and knowing where they are so you don't have to keep looking down is important. So, we will forcus on the right side first. On the rght side you will have both brake, your right are will control the front brake located on the handlebars and your right foot will control the rear brake which is just forward of your foot peg. The left side of your body will control the clutch and shifting required to change gears. the clutch is located on the left side of the handlebars and the shifter is located in front of the left foot. 
    <br>
    In addtion to knowing where those key controls are you will need to know how to start the motorcyle. This is a little different then with a car because there are a few things that will prevent ignition. the first step is obviously put the key in and turn it to the on position.
